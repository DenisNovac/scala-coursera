#Submitting your Solution to Coursera

The sbt task submit allows you to submit your solution for the assignment. It will pack your source code into a .jar file and upload it to the coursera servers. Note that the code can only be submitted if there are no compilation errors.

Warnings: Before proceeding:

- Make sure that you run sbt in the root folder of the project (where the build.sbt file is).
- Make sure that the console line is `>` and not `scala>`. Otherwise, you're inside the Scala console and not the sbt shell.

The submit tasks takes two arguments: your Coursera e-mail address and the submission token. NOTE: the submission token is not your login password. Instead, it's a special password generated by coursera for every assignment. It is available on the Assignments page.

```bash

You can also submit your work without starting the sbt interactive shell, by running the following command:

```bash

$ sbt "submit e-mail@university.org suBmISsioNPasSwoRd"
```
